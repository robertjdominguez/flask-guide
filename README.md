# flask-guide
Step-by-step tutorial for building a simple Flask application using Python; optimized for use in a CS class.


## What We'll Do
By following along with this project and our lesson(s), you'll walk away with a skeleton for a fully functional Flask web-app. You'll have several roles for users, a db with several tables, and basic authentication. This is meant to serve as a template; however, the basic framework will allow you to create apps of any kind/focus.
